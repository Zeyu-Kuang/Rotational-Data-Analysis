This folder contains the result of the OLS_Optimization program.

It contains values and standard deviations of one SME coefficient (specified by its index). Different values correspond to different slicing numbers (N_s).

relation of the index to SME coefficient:
co_dict = {'0': '$c^T_Q$', '1': '$c^T_X$','2': '$c^T_Y$','3': '$c^T_Z$','4': '$c^T_M$','5': '$c^T_\_$'}  # for displaying on y label
