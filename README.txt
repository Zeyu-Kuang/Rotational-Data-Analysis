This folder is designed for analysing the data generated by rotational table. 

Two main approaches are under tested:
1. using DLS: less memory required but (? might lose information) 
2. using OLS: more memory required, two ways are developed to shorten the data set (? without losing information)
    1. OLS with slicing
    2. OLS with averaging
    
The rest of the folder is organized as follows:
1. Data folder: 
    1. .\Data\original\ contains raw data obtained from Micheal
    2. .\Data\DLS1\ contains intermidiate result generated in DLS method (result from DLS1 stage).
    3. .\Data\file_location_run_8.txt contains the location of data files from run 8.
    4. .\Data\file_location_run_9.txt contains the location of data files from run 9.
